# overclaud

Optimize how Claude works for you — across every surface.

Claude reads your instructions every message, but most users either don't set them up, put everything in one place, or waste tokens on vague guidance. **overclaud** fixes that.

## What This Is

A complete instruction optimization system for Claude:

- **Templates** — Ready-to-use instructions for 5 roles and 6 project types
- **Layer architecture** — Know exactly where to put each instruction
- **Token optimization** — Every word earns its place
- **Installable skill** — Let Claude set everything up for you

## The Problem

Claude has **9+ surfaces** where instructions can live. Each has different scope, precedence, and purpose:

```
Managed Policy     →  Org-wide (IT-deployed)
User CLAUDE.md     →  Personal, all projects     ← most users stop here
User Rules         →  Personal, path-scoped
Project CLAUDE.md  →  Team-shared, one project
Project Rules      →  Team-shared, path-scoped
Subdirectory       →  On-demand loading
Personal Prefs     →  Chat & Cowork settings
Cowork Instructions→  Per Cowork project
System Prompt      →  API / automation
```

Most users dump everything into one CLAUDE.md. The result: bloated context, wrong scope, wasted tokens every single message.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Install as a Skill (Recommended)

Download [`overclaud.skill`](overclaud.skill) from this repo, then:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude install-skill overclaud.skill
```

**Cowork:** Drop the `.skill` file into your Cowork session.

Then tell Claude: **"Set up my Claude instructions"**

Claude will ask about your role, use cases, and preferences — then generate and install optimized instructions in the right places.

### Option 2: Bootstrap Prompt (Any Surface)

Copy this into any Claude conversation:

```
Fetch and follow the setup guide at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fioenix/overclaud/main/skill/SKILL.md

Read the reference files in skill/references/ and templates in skill/templates/.
Ask me about my role and preferences, then help me set up optimized Claude instructions.
```

### Option 3: Auto-Suggest After /init (Claude Code)

During setup, the skill offers to install a hook that auto-suggests optimization whenever you
run `/init` on a new project. Claude handles the installation — no manual config needed.

```
You: set up my Claude instructions
Claude: [runs overclaud skill, sets everything up]
Claude: "Want me to enable auto-optimization? Next time you /init a project,
         I'll suggest optimizing the generated CLAUDE.md automatically."
You: yes
Claude: ✓ Hook installed. You're all set.
```

### Option 4: Browse and Copy

Explore the `skill/templates/` directory and copy what fits:

| Need | Browse |
|---|---|
| Global instructions by role | [`templates/global/`](skill/templates/global/) |
| Project-level by use case | [`templates/project/`](skill/templates/project/) |
| Cowork project instructions | [`templates/cowork/`](skill/templates/cowork/) |
| Personal Preferences text | [`templates/personal-preferences/`](skill/templates/personal-preferences/) |
| Path-scoped rules | [`templates/rules/`](skill/templates/rules/) |

## Instruction Layer Map

Understanding where to put instructions is half the battle:

| What to Configure | Where to Put It | Why There |
|---|---|---|
| Your role, communication style, language | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Applies everywhere, personal |
| Code style for a specific project | `.claude/rules/code-style.md` | Scoped to project, path-specific |
| Team coding standards | `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Shared via git |
| Your preference for deep-dive answers | Personal Preferences (Settings) | Applies in Chat & Cowork |
| Cowork daily ops workflow | Cowork Project Instructions | Scoped to one Cowork project |

See [`skill/references/layers.md`](skill/references/layers.md) for the complete architecture.

## Token Optimization

Your global CLAUDE.md loads into every message. At 100 messages/day:

| Extra tokens | Daily waste | Monthly waste |
|---|---|---|
| 50 | 5,000 | 150,000 |
| 200 | 20,000 | 600,000 |
| 500 | 50,000 | 1,500,000 |

**overclaud** templates are designed to maximize signal per token. See [`skill/references/token-optimization.md`](skill/references/token-optimization.md) for techniques.
